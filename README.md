# STM32 for VSCode

This is a supporting extension to setup STM32 projects generated from STM CubeMX. It automatically generates a makefile and starts the build process, it also adds debugging, build and flash configurations to the workspace.

It also supports using cpp files, however for this main.c has to ben manualy renamed to main.cpp for it to work.

To use the extension use the cmd/ctrl+shift+p shortcut to open the commands panel and run the Build STM project command. This will setup the project and start the building process.

This project depends on a few dependencies so make sure they are installed before using this extension.

## Prerequisites
There are a few command line tools that needs to be added to the PATH for this extension to work. On top of this the Cortex-Debug extension needs to be installed for debugging. Should any of the command line tools not be installed you will get a warning stating which one is missing. The requirements are stated below.


- [STM32 CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)
- [Cortex-Debug extension](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug)
- [ST-Link (Drivers and Utility)](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html)
- [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
- Make (platform dependend, [Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), OSX: install command line developer tools)

## Configuring CubeMX
This extension assumes the project initialised with CubeMX and the option to create a Makefile project under Project Manager->Project->Toolchain/IDE.

Also please leave the default on Copy all used libraries into the project folder and generate seperate .c and .h files for the peripherals.

## How to use
Use cmd/ctrl+shift+p to open the show all commands panel and issue the command: Build STM32 project. Please note that external libraries should be placed in the lib folder and source code should be place in the src and inc folders.

## Features
- Creating a makefile and building and STM32 project.
- Adding configurations for debugging, flashing and building in the workspace.
- Ability to compile it as a C++ project by adding a main.cpp file.
- Automatic configuration of intellisense.
- Detection of required tools and creating a warning.

## Disclaimer
This an extension created because I wanted a fast way to build, flash and debug STM32 on OSX in VSCode. This extension is used internally at Peter Chen for development, and branch from [bmd-studio](https://github.com/bmd-studio/stm32-for-vscode). As this might be helpfull to others I have allocated time to publish this extension. Should you find any bugs or have feature requests please open an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/thinksrc/stm32-for-vscode).
